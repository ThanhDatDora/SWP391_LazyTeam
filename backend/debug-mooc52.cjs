// debug-mooc52.cjs: deactivated — original script moved to backup_20251106_200503
// This file intentionally left blank to avoid accidental execution in main workspace.
// Removed direct mssql require to prevent accidental DB connections.

// If you need to re-enable this script, follow the DB_USAGE_GUIDELINES in backend/
// and import the shared pool helper like other maintenance scripts.
