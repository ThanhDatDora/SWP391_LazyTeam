Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "question_id": 1082,
      "mooc_id": 52,
      "stem": "What is React?",
      "qtype": "mcq",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "max_score": 10,
      "options": [
        {
          "option_id": 4345,
          "label": "A",
          "content": "A JavaScript library",

        },
